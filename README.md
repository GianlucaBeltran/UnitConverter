## Goal

The goal of this project was to practice what i had learned about Swift and SwiftUI and make an app i could actually use. 

The focus of the app is to convert units, currently it converts:

- Length
- Temperature
- Mass
- Time

#### User Interface

I decided to go for a one page format, using a slider to change between units that are being converted.

I tried to follow the same functionality as the chrome unit converter, so both inputs works, meaning you can write directly into the `To` input and the from value will change and if you choose unit from the picker that is set on the other input they will swap places retaining the value that was set in the `From` input.
